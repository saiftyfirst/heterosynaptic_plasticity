## _Abstract_

_Neurons are connected by points of contact, known as synapses. A fundamental property_

_of such a synapse is that the strength of the connection it represents is plastic rather than_

_static. In other words, each synapse has a weight associated with it, which represents the_

_strength of the connection between the presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron, and these_

_weights are subject to change owing to the activity pattern of the two neurons. This dynamic_

_characteristic of synapses is termed plasticity._

_Experimentally, we can distinguish between to forms of plasticity: homosynaptic and heterosynaptic_

_plasticity. The two forms differ in their requirement of presynaptic activity_

_during induction. Homosynaptic plasticity is induced in synapses whose presynaptic neurons_

_are directly involved in the plasticity induction process whereas the heterosynaptic_

_case is associated with synapses of presynaptic neurons that are not involved in the induction_

_[ 5 ]._

_In our work, we review existing literature on heterosynaptic plasticity, including experimental_

_evidence as well as the potential roles of this form of plasticity. Furthermore,_

_we use an experimental study to device models of heterosynaptic plasticity to investigate_

_synapse-level implications of this form of plasticity [ 28 ]._

_In order to investigate the effects of our heterosynaptic plasticity mechanism, we use classical,_

_pair-based STDP rules to induce homosynaptic plasticity and augment the STDP to_

_account for the heterosynaptic effects. We use different simulation setups to obtain insights_

_into suitable STDP kernels for heterosyanptically-active neurons as well to analyse_

_spatial patterns that emerge along dendrites due to specific configurations of initial synaptic_

_weights._

_We implemented a framework for heterosynaptic plasticity into our existing program for_

_spiking network models to facilitate our simulations. Additionally, an important design_

_goal of the framework was to allow rapid extendibility in terms of new heterosynaptic_

_rules as more experimental or theoretical data on the topic comes to surface.
